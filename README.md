# Building-Deploying-DLProject
Building a FoodVision based on Deep learning
#### - Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model based on EfficientNet-B1 and ViT (Vision Transformer) architectures for image recognition and classification.
##### - Allows the user to upload an image of food.
##### - The app processes the image, identifies the food type, and provides a prediction of the dish.
##### - The model is trained on a large dataset of food images, allowing it to accurately identify different types of cuisine and dishes.
##### - The use of EfficientNet-B1 and ViT architectures provides improved accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional CNNs.
##### - The app is designed to be user-friendly and provides a quick and efficient way to classify food images.
